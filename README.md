# MotivationBot
MotivationBot is a Windows console application that gets motivational/inspirational quotes from [Zen Quotes API](https://docs.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/) and posts them to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UsernameIsHope).

## Motivation

I developed this application to help people who may be going through hard times. To let them know that they are not alone.
