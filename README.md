# MotivationBot
MotivationBot is a windows console application that gets motivational/inspirational quotes from a free API (https://type.fit/api/quotes) and posts them to Twitter (https://twitter.com/UsernameIsHope)

# Motivation

I developed this application to help people who may be going through hard times. To let them know that they are not alone.


# App Config

The App.config file is not available as it contains sensitive information. Look at the AppConfigExample.txt file to see how the App.cofig file should be.
